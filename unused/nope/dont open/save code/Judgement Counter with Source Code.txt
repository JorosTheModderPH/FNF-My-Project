	judgementCounter.setFormat(Paths.font("comic-sans.ttf"), 20, FlxColor.WHITE, FlxTextAlign.LEFT, FlxTextBorderStyle.OUTLINE, FlxColor.BLACK);
	judgementCounter.borderSize = 2;
	judgementCounter.borderQuality = 2;
	judgementCounter.scrollFactor.set();
	judgementCounter.cameras = [camHUD];
	judgementCounter.screenCenter(Y);
	judgementCounter.text = 'Sicks: ${sicks}\nGoods: ${goods}\nBads: ${bads}\nShits: ${shits}\nMisses: ${songMisses}';

lastly find this line
